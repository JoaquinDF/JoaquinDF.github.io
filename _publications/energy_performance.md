excerpt: 'The building energy sector accounts for a large quantity of carbon emissions, making it essential for driving the global sustainable transformation and achieving the targets set in the Paris climate agreement. Increasing buildings` energy efficiency needs exact predictions of building energy performance for planning and investment decisions. In this context, data-driven methods, mostly machine learning, have been explored, offering high prediction performance. However, data-driven methods require substantial amounts of data for accurate predictions. In practice, energy consultants and energy consultancy agencies typically do not have an extensive database and are not willing to share their data among themselves. To address these issues, we applied a decentralized, privacy-preserving machine learning approach, called federated learning (FL), to a dataset of more than 25,000 residential buildings with different construction properties and energy sources, simulating different energy agencies by splitting by geographical region. The prediction performance is then compared to a model with access to the whole dataset and a fully isolated local model. The results show that FL yields 12\% better prediction performance results than the isolated model, enabling it to leverage the full potential of scaling data-driven methods and spurring the development of new business models in research and practice.'
