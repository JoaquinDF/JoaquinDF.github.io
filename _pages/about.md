## About Myself
In 2023 I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Luxembourg with a thesis titled: "Breaking data silos with Federated Learning" nominated for the Best thesis award of 2023. 

Since then I've had the privilege of serving as a Researcher at the Interdisciplinary Center for Security, Reliability, and Trust <a href="https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/">(SNT)</a> 

I have extensive experience in the private sector, where I gained hands-on experience with real machine-learning applications. During my doctorate, I expanded my expertise to include the development of solutions to evaluate sensitive machine-learning applications using distributed multi-party computation systems (federated learning) in conjunction with privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy or secure aggregation. My research has particular applications in the energy sector, where I focus on load forecasting

Through my work, I have become proficient in utilizing High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources to accelerate the computation of complex machine learning models.
